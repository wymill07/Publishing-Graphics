        <h1>
          Jarret Eaton earns bronze in 60 meter race at World Indoor Track and Field Championships
        </h1>

        <p>
          By Wyatt Miller
        </p>

        <p>
          Former Syracuse All-American Jarret Eaton earned a bronze medal in the 60-meter hurdles at the World Indoor Track and Field Championships in Belgrade, Serbia, on Sunday.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eaton finished in 7.53 seconds after a 7.52-second finish in the semifinals and is the only NCAA individual champion in Syracuse track and field history, winning the 60-meter hurdles in 2016.
        </p>

        <p>
          A 2012 U.S. Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association First Team All-American for SU, Eaton finished sixth overall in the 110-meter hurdles at the NCAA Championship at 13.83 seconds. He qualified for that event with a school-record time of 13.44 seconds at the NCAA East Preliminary Round, finishing second overall.
        </p>

        <p>
          In his junior season, he earned two NCAA Regional-qualifying times in the 110-meter hurdles, winning the Big East title in the event with a 13.85-second finish. That was the season’s fastest time in the 110-meter hurdles from the Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America preliminaries. Eaton was then named the Northeast Region Men’s Athlete of the Year.
        </p>

        <p>
          On top of this world indoor bronze, Eaton has three other professional medals on his resume. He earned silver at the 2018 world indoor where he set his career high in the event (7.43 seconds). He also won bronze in the U.S. Indoor Championship in 2016 and at the 2019 Pan-Am Games. Eaton currently ranks 30th nationally in the 110m hurdles.
